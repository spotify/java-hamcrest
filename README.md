## Getting Started

### POJO matchers
[![Javadocs](http://www.javadoc.io/badge/com.spotify/hamcrest-pojo.svg?color=blue)](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.spotify/hamcrest-pojo)

Many applications at Spotify are very data heavy.  They might be
aggregation services that combine a lot of data structures into even
more complicated data structures.  And the basic data structures are
usually complicated to begin with.

The POJO matcher library lets you describe the structure of a POJO in
a fluent style and then match against that structure.  It's optimized
for very complicated objects with a lot of properties.  When a
mismatch occurs, the library tries to minimally describe the mismatch.

Example:

```java
final List<User> users;
try (Stream<User> userStream = sut.fetchAllUsers()) {
  users = userStream.collect(Collectors.toList());
}

assertThat(users, contains(
    pojo(User.class)
        .where("address", is(
            pojo(Address.class)
                .withProperty("street", is("Main Street"))
                .withProperty("country", is("US"))
        ))
        .where("product", is(
            pojo(Product.class)
                .withProperty("id", is(1))
                .withProperty("name", is("premium"))
                .withProperty("metadata", is("{\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}"))
                .withProperty("creationDate", is(Timestamp.from(Instant.EPOCH)))
                .withProperty("isTest", is(false))
        ))
));
```

Example output:

```
Expected:
iterable containing [User {
  address(): is Address {
    getStreet(): is "Main Street"
    getCountry(): is "US"
  }
  product(): is Product {
    getId(): is <1>
    getName(): is "premium"
    getMetadata(): is "{\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}"
    getCreationDate(): is <1970-01-01 01:00:00.0>
    getIsTest(): is <false>
  }
}]

but:
item 0: User {
  ...
  product(): Product {
    ...
    getMetadata(): was "{\"foo\": \"bar\"}"
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

### JSON matchers
[![Javadocs](http://www.javadoc.io/badge/com.spotify/hamcrest-jackson.svg?color=blue)](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.spotify/hamcrest-jackson)

Similar to the POJO matchers, the JSON matchers let you describe a
JSON structure and match against it.

The match can be on a `String` or a jackson `JsonNode`. 

```java
// You can match a String
String jsonString = "{" +
 "  \"foo\": 1," +
 "  \"bar\": true," +
 "  \"baz\": {" +
 "    \"foo\": true" +
 "  }" +
 "}"

// You can match a Json String directly
assertThat("{}", isJsonStringMatching(jsonObject()));

// Or match a Jackson node
JsonNode json = new ObjectMapper().readTree(jsonString);
assertThat(json, is(
     jsonObject()
         .where("foo", is(jsonInt(1)))
         .where("bar", is(jsonBoolean(true)))
         .where("baz", is(
             jsonObject()
                 .where("foo", is(jsonNull()))))));
```

A failing test would look like:

```
Expected:
{
  "foo": is a number node is <1>
  "bar": is a boolean node is <false>
  "baz": is {
    "foo": is a null node
  }
}

but:
{
  ...
  "baz": {
    ...
    "foo": was not a null node, but a boolean node
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

### java.util.Optional matchers
[![Javadocs](http://www.javadoc.io/badge/com.spotify/hamcrest-optional.svg?color=blue)](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.spotify/hamcrest-optional)

`com.spotify:hamcrest-optional` provides matchers for the Java 8
Optional type so you don't have to unpack the Optional in your tests.

```java
final Optional<String> response = methodUnderTest();
assertThat(response, hasValue(equalTo("foo"));

final Optional<Collection<Foo>> col = anotherMethod();
assertThat(response, hasValue(containsInAnyOrder(...)));

// or if you only care that the Optional is non-empty:
assertThat(response, hasValue());

// or if you expect an empty Optional:
assertThat(response, isEmpty());
```

### Future matchers
[![Javadocs](http://www.javadoc.io/badge/com.spotify/hamcrest-future.svg?color=blue)](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.spotify/hamcrest-future)

Similar to the Optional matchers, the CompletionStage /
CompletableFuture matchers in `com.spotify:hamcrest-future` allow
you to assert against the value or completion state of a
CompletionStage without having to unpack it in your test code or
handle the checked exceptions of `Future.get()` (or using
`Futures.getUnchecked(future)`).

There are four dimensions you can choose from when using Future
matchers:

  * raw `Future` vs Java 8's `CompletableFuture`
  * blocking vs non-blocking
      * blocking: the matcher will wait, perhaps indefinitely, for the
        future to complete
      * non-blocking: the matcher will not match if the future is not
        yet completed
  * completed successfully vs completed with an exception
  * match anything vs pass in another matcher

So there are a total of 16 methods you can call:

#### raw `Future` matchers

Use `com.spotify.hamcrest.future.FutureMatchers`:

|             | blocking                                | non-blocking |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| successful  | futureWillCompleteWithValue\[That]()     | futureCompletedWithValue\[That]() |
| exceptional | futureWillCompleteWithException\[That]() | futureCompletedWithException\[That]() |

#### Java 8's `CompletableFuture` matchers

Use `com.spotify.hamcrest.future.CompletableFutureMatchers`:

|             | blocking                               | non-blocking |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| successful  | stageWillCompleteWithValue\[That]()     | stageCompletedWithValue\[That]() |
| exceptional | stageWillCompleteWithException\[That]() | stageCompletedWithException\[That]() |

Note that to test that a CompletionStage completed with a certain
value or exception use `..That(..)`.

```java
CompletionStage<List<Foo>> f = someMethod();
assertThat(f, stageCompletedWithValueThat(contains(...));

CompletionStage<Foo> c = methodThatShouldFail();
assertThat(c, stageCompletedWithExceptionThat(isA(FooException.class)));
```

If you want the matcher to block until the CompletionStage is
completed, use `stageWillCompleteWithValueThat(..)`:

```java
// warning: might block forever if the stage never completes!
CompletionStage<List<Foo>> f = someMethod();
assertThat(f, stageWillCompleteWithValueThat(is(equalTo(...)));
```

Be careful when using this matcher as it might block forever if the
stage never completes! Consider restructuring your tests so that the
completions returned from the method/class being tested are
immediately completed (e.g. using MoreExecutors.directExecutor, etc).

### Javaslang Matchers
[![Javadocs](http://www.javadoc.io/badge/com.spotify/hamcrest-javaslang.svg?color=blue)](http://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.spotify/hamcrest-javaslang)

[Javaslang](http://www.javaslang.io/) is a library inspired by Scala,
providing elements of functional programming to Java 8. Javaslang has
an emphasis on immutable values. The `hamcrest-javaslang` package provides
matchers for various Javaslang value types. Currently, `Try`, `Option`, and `Either`
are supported.

```java
assertThat(Try.of(42), successfulTry(equalTo(42)));
assertThat(Either.right("val"), not(leftTry(anything())));
assertThat(Option.of(3.14), definedOption(equalTo(3.14)));
```

Expect more Javaslang values to be supported in the future.
